            Get Your Hack On is happening May 13-15 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Students who are interested in web programming, graphic design, software and technology development are invited to participate.

          <p>
            Similar to "Startup Weekend Honolulu" and "City Camp," there will be outside judges from startups, and prizes. This is part of a series of workshops to help ready oneself to create a software application within ~50 hours. We will also be hosting a series of events to help the students prepare for the actual competition.
